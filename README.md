# PurCheaper

**Same-day device pickup logistics for online buyback stores.**

Pilot market: **Salt Lake City metro — Wasatch Front (Ogden → Salt Lake City → Provo), Utah.**

PurCheaper connects cell phone / device buyback websites with sellers at home via trained gig-economy drivers. Drivers verify the device against the buyback site’s quoted specs, pack it to SOP, and unlock **same-day seller payment** when everything matches — a competitive edge in a crowded mail-in market.

## Why this product

- **Buyback sites** need faster cash-to-seller without taking on blind fraud risk.
- **Sellers** abandon quotes when payout is “7–14 days after we receive the phone.”
- **PurCheaper** inserts doorstep verification + packing so payment can fire the same day **only after a match**.

## Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, JSON file store, JWT + API keys
- **Frontend:** Dense static HTML/CSS/JS (no build step) served by Express
- **Auth:** Partner JWT / `X-API-Key`, Driver JWT

## Order lifecycle

```
pending → assigned → en_route → picked_up → verifying → verified → paid
                                              ↘ mismatch (pay held)
```

1. Buyback partner creates an order (dashboard or API) with `expected_specs` and `quoted_amount`.
2. Trained driver claims / is assigned and goes en route.
3. Driver picks up, runs verification checklist, packs device.
4. **Match** → `verified` → partner releases same-day pay.
5. **Mismatch** → `mismatch` → partner reviews before any funds move.

## How PurCheaper makes money

Partners pay **platform + per completed pickup** (see `/partners#pricing`).  
Your cost is mainly **driver + pack kit + risk + ops** (~$27 default; override with `COGS_*` env vars).  

**Contribution** = partner invoice − COGS on completed pickups.  
The partner dashboard **This month · money** panel shows both **their spend** and **your estimated profit** on their volume.

## Launch

1. Set a strong `JWT_SECRET` and `NODE_ENV=production` on the host.  
2. Walk `/launch` checklist.  
3. Create a real partner account (or use demo seed only for demos).  
4. Point a domain at the Node process (or put it behind a reverse proxy).  
5. Review `/privacy` and `/terms` with counsel before scale.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit JWT_SECRET, COGS_*, PORT
npm start
```
